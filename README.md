## How to use this project?

Visit the application [here](https://smart-brain-detkova.herokuapp.com/).

If you want to play around without **Registering** please use following credentials:

Email: `john@gmail.com`

Password: `123`

You can also **Register** with your own credentials and then **Sign In**. Once you are logged in, grab any image URL with a human face and paste it in the input bar. As a result you should get a square around the face (aka the face was recognized) and the count number should jump by 1. 

Every time you successfully submit an image URL of human face, it will be recognized and the count will jump by 1 - play with your friends and see who gets the highest score! :video_game:
